The provided code performs computer vision tasks related to camera calibration and reconstruction.

Loading the image and reading the world coordinates:
The code begins by loading an image file named 'house1.png' using the OpenCV library.]

Displaying the image and allowing user point selection:
The code defines a callback function select_point that is triggered when the user clicks on the image window.
Within the callback function, the clicked coordinates are appended to the points list, and a red circle is drawn at that location on the image.
The image with selected points is continuously displayed to the user until either the user selects ten points or presses the Esc key.
The selected points are stored in the points list.
Converting selected points to a numpy array:
The code converts the selected points from a list to a numpy array and assigns it to the variable selected_points.


Task 1: Finding the intersection point:
The code initializes an empty list intersection_points to store the closest intersection point for each selected point.
It iterates over the selected points and calculates the Euclidean distance between each selected point and the known world coordinates.
The closest intersection point is determined by finding the world coordinate with the minimum distance to the selected point.
The closest intersection points are stored in the intersection_points list.


Task 2: Reconstructing the projection matrix P using the DLT algorithm:
The code initializes an empty matrix A to construct the linear system of equations.
It iterates over the intersection points and constructs the matrix A using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is then used to decompose A and obtain the projection matrix P.


Task 3: Recovering the camera calibration matrix K, camera orientation R, and camera center C from P:
The code applies the QR decomposition to extract the camera calibration matrix K and camera orientation R from the projection matrix P.
The camera calibration matrix K is normalized by dividing by the value in the bottom-right corner.
The translation vector T is computed by inverting K and multiplying it with the last column of P.
The camera center C is then obtained by multiplying the transpose of R with T.
Finally, the code prints the camera calibration matrix K, camera orientation R, and camera center C.


The code essentially allows to select points of interest in the image, finds the corresponding 3D points, and performs camera calibration and reconstruction to determine the camera parameters.
